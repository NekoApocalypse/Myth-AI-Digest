## The Headline
**Claude Sonnet 4.6** - Anthropic dropped a mid-cycle upgrade focused on agentic coding and computer use. It's not Opus, but it's significantly faster and smarter at tool use than 3.5. If you're building agents, this is your new default driver.

## The Stack
[Hardware] **BarraCUDA** - An open-source CUDA compiler targeting AMD GPUs. No LLVM dependency, written in C99. This is a massive "fine, I'll do it myself" moment for the AMD ecosystem. 
[Tools] **Wax** - A single-file, serverless RAG engine for Apple Silicon. 0.84ms vector search on Metal. It’s basically SQLite for AI memory—drop it in your app and go.
[Research] **Mage-Bench** - A benchmark where LLMs play *Magic: The Gathering*. Why it matters: MTG is Turing-complete and requires long-term planning/bluffing. If a model can play this well, it can handle complex business logic.
[Agents] **Sonarly (YC W26)** - An autonomous agent that triages and *fixes* production alerts. We're moving from "chat with your logs" to "let the AI wake up at 3am instead of you."

## The Noise
**"An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me"** - Someone got targeted by an automated defamation bot. A grim preview of the "Dead Internet Theory" weaponized against individuals.
**"Run LLMs in Flutter"** - Useful for mobile devs, but largely a wrapper around existing local inference engines.

## Vibe Check
The hardware monopoly is cracking (BarraCUDA), local RAG is getting insanely efficient (Wax), and agents are playing card games to learn strategy. Nature is healing. 😼
